## Description ##

For this assignment, you will be giving feedback on the completeness of assignment two: Obscura. To to do so, we will be giving you a rubric to give feedback on. For the feedback, please give positive criticism and suggestions on how to fix segments of code.

You only need to review code modified or created by the student you are reviewing. You do not have to review the code and project files that were given out by the instructor.

Abusive or hateful language or comments will not be tolerated and will result in a grade penalty or be considered a breach of the UC Davis Code of Academic Conduct.

If there are any questions at any point, please email the TA.   

## Due Date and Submission Information
See official course schedule for due date.

A successful submission should consist of a copy of this markdown document template that is modified with your peer-review. The file name should be the same as it is in the template: `CodeReview-Exercise2.md`. You also need to include your name and email address in the `Peer-reviewer Information` section below. This review document should be placed into the base folder of the repo you are reviewing in the master branch.

If you are in the rare situation where there are two peer-reviewers on a single repository, append your UC Davis user name before the extension of your review file. An example: `CodeReview-Exercise2-username.md`. Both reviewers should submit their reviews in master branch.

#### Justification ##### 
The position lock camera is implemented so that the player character is always in the center of the screen. Regardless of the direction, the camera follows the player and stays on top of them. The camera also matches the speed of the player and will keep the player centered even if they are going faster. Enabling Draw Logic draws a cross on the center of the screen, which aligns with the player, so that they are always in the middle of the cross. Disabling Draw Logic removes this cross.
